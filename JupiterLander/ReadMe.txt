Notes:
	* Once you are in the game over screen you can restart the game by pressing
	  the space bar
	* Need a support for OpenGL 3.3, since I used explicit attribut location
	  using "layout(location = <Some int>)" and not glBindAttribLocation.
	
 
Easter Eggs:

	* Collecting 5 diamonds grants an extra life
	* Resurrection (Can revive yourself after the gameover screen?):
	  	Strange that during the game over screen the rate at which diamonds fall is
	  	greatly increased. Too bad you can't collect them ... or can't you? It's not
		unimaginable that the pilot could survived. She may not be as mobile but if
		a diamond was to fall on to her, she will surely collect it... 
	* Ephemeral objects: 
		Some objects slowly fade before they disappear. 
		Chase your pokeball or the diamonds to see.
